## **How SuperNote Was Built** 🏗️  

SuperNote was developed following a structured, **iterative development process**, ensuring that each phase of the project focused on usability, functionality, and scalability.  

### **1️⃣ Planning and Research**  
   - Identified the core problems faced by students in note-sharing.  
   - Conducted competitor analysis (e.g., Course Hero, Studocu, Notion) to define unique features.  
   - Outlined system architecture and feature roadmap.  

### **2️⃣ Backend Development**  
   - **Built with Node.js and Express.js** to handle API requests efficiently.  
   - **MongoDB for database management**, allowing flexible and scalable data storage.  
   - Implemented **JWT-based authentication** for secure user logins.  
   - Integrated **AWS S3 for file storage**, ensuring reliable and fast access to uploaded notes.

## **4️⃣ AI-Powered Summarization with LLaMA & OpenAI** 🤖  

One of the standout features of SuperNote is its **AI-powered summarization**, which helps students quickly grasp key takeaways from long notes.  

### **How AI Summarization Works**  
Since notes can be **too large** for a single model to process efficiently, we **combine two AI models**:  

1. **LLaMA (Meta AI)**  
   - **First stage of summarization**  
   - Extracts the **main ideas** from the lengthy note  
   - Generates a **concise version** that retains key points  

2. **OpenAI's GPT (ChatGPT API)**  
   - **Final refinement and optimization**  
   - Takes LLaMA’s summary and **further condenses** it  
   - Ensures the summary is **coherent, well-structured, and readable**  

By **chaining** these two AI models, we efficiently process large notes while maintaining **high-quality summarization** with a natural language flow.
